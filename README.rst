cluttool - create and convert 3D/color LUTs
-------------------------------------------

This tool is a sort of swiss army knife for color LUTs.  Color LUTs concisely
describe linear color transformations that many video monitors and post
production software can understand.  There are a relatively small number of
color LUT file formats, such as 3D LUT and Hald CLUT, but no one LUT format is
used by every software and firmware system.  This tool may help you to convert
between LUT formats, or generate new ones in the format that you need.

Supported file formats:
-----------------------

* PNG (.png)
* 3D LUT (.3dl)
